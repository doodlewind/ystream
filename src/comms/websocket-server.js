/* A few users have reported having issues understanding backpressure and how to deal with it.
 *
 * Backpressure is the buildup of unacknowledged data; you can't just call ws.send without checking for backpressure.
 * Data doesn't just, poof, immediately jump from your server to the receiver - the receiver has to actually... receive it.
 * That happens with ACKs, controlling the transmission window.
 *
 * See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket/bufferedAmount
 *
 * Backpressure applies to all streams, files, sockets, queues, and so on. If you're building
 * web services without taking backpressure into account you're not developing proper solutions - you're dicking around.
 *
 * Any slow receiver can DOS your whole server if you're not taking backpressure into account.
 *
 * The following is a (ridiculous) example of how data can be pushed according to backpressure.
 * Do not take this as a way to actually write code, this is horrible, but it shows the concept clearly.
